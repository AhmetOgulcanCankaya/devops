Build Automation and Continuous Integration

AT
Java - ant,maven,gradle
JS - npm,gulp
Unix based systems - Make
Building virtual machine images and containers - Packer
CI
Jenkins - open source fork of hudson | builds,tests,deploys widely used | Java servlet based
TravisCI - open source | built around Github integration | executes builds in clean VMs
Bamboo - enterprised by Atlassian

Configuration Management

Ansible - open source | declarative configuration,tool determines what is necessery for the declaration | YAML configuration files | No control server needed,but Ansible tower is available but not required | Does not need agents, just python and ssh

VMs has an entire OS built into them.
VMWare ESX | Microsoft Hyper-V | Citrix XenServer
CT
Only simulates the OS in a very thin, light way
Docker 
They are portable.

Monitoring

{ELK,Beats-ElasticSearch-LogStash-Kibana}

Infrastructure Monitoring
CPU,RAM monitoring

APM Application Performance Monitoring
Response times,logs

IMT
Sensoo - replacement of nagios | Server/Agent arch | Agents push data to an AMQP broker
NewRelic - SaaS solution | SaaS + Agent | Good for APM too
APMT
AppDynamics - Presents data in a dashboard | Server/agent | Code level diagnostics

Orchestration Tools
Automatically scale up and down at event or action

Docker-swarm - Dockers native OrcTool | for Docker containers
Kubernetes - open source | uses a orc. server | manages apps across multiple hosts
Zookeeper - open source by Apache Foundation | can work alogside Kubernetes
